# ElliGraph :triumph:
This is a web application created as a passion project in my sophomore year of highschool. The app allows users to graph ellipses by providing the values for the major axis (a) and minor axis (b). It uses the Streamlit library in Python to provide an interactive and user-friendly interface.

# How to Use :question:
-Open your web browser and go to https://luxiopy-elligraph-grapherwebapp-7v5bjh.streamlit.app/.

-Once the web app is loaded, you will see an interface with two sliders labeled "Major Axis (a)" and "Minor Axis (b)".

-Adjust the sliders to set the values for the major axis (a) and minor axis (b) of the ellipse. As you change the values, the graph of the ellipse will automatically update in real-time.

-Explore different combinations of major and minor axis values to visualize various ellipses. The graph will reflect the changes immediately, allowing you to observe the effects on the shape and size of the ellipse.

-You can also view the major axis, minor axis, and eccentricity values displayed below the sliders.

-Feel free to experiment, analyze different ellipse configurations, and gain insights into how changing the major and minor axes affects the shape of the ellipse.


# Features :running:
- Graph ellipses by inputting the major axis (a) and minor axis (b) values, across a slider.
- Sliders for a and b to easily adjust the values and see the updated graph.
- Display of major and minor axis values.
- Automatic handling of edge cases and error messages for invalid inputs.
- Interactive graph visualization using Matplotlib and NumPy.
- Designed to be intuitive and accessible for users of all levels.


# Technologies Used :point_down:
- Python
- Streamlit
- Matplotlib
- NumPy


# About Me :wave:

Hi! My name is Zion, i'm currently in highschool, pursuing a career in softwarer engineering. I have a deep passion for computer science and software engineering. I love exploring the endless possibilities that coding offers and applying those concepts to various subjects, including math, physics, and more. I also enjoy some good cold brewed iced coffee :coffee:.

Ever since I started coding, I've been fascinated by how programming can be used to solve complex problems and bring ideas to life. It's incredibly rewarding to see the intersection of creativity and logic in action. I have a new found goal of creating projects like these to grow my knowledge of programming and software engineering, every year, no matter what it takes.

This project, an ellipse graphing web app, is one of my endeavors to combine my interests in programming and physics. I believe that visualizing mathematical concepts can greatly aid in understanding and appreciation. Through this project, I aim to create an intuitive and interactive tool that makes exploring ellipses enjoyable and educational.

I'm always eager to learn and grow, so if you have any suggestions, questions, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out.

Happy Graphing!
